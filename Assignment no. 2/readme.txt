# GRADEBOOK ANALYZER
This mini project helps automate the entire process via a Python-based GradeBook Analyzer CLI.
The system will read marks from input or a CSV file, perform key statistical analysis, assign grades, and generate summaries in a user-friendly format.

# FEATURES
•	Read and store student marks from manual input or CSV into Python data structures.
•	Implement core statistical functions (mean, median, min, max).
•	Use control flow constructs to assign and summarize letter grades.
•	Apply list comprehensions for conditional filtering.
•	Practice modular programming with functions and loops.
•	Format tabular output and implement a CLI loop for repeated analysis.
